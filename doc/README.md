## gRPC + Protocol Buffers

* [What is gRPC?](http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html)
* [What are Protocol Buffers?](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)

## Why Use a Makefile?

Microservices are often written by different teams using different technologies. A Makefile answers common questions such as:

* How do I build this application?
* How do I run tests?

The Makefile can also be used as a self-documenting and stable interface for the CI system.
